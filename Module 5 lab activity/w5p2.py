# The program takes the following list of numbers and use a for loop to print each number and its
# square to the screen, each value on a new line:
# num_list = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]

num_list = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]

for num in num_list:
    square = num ** 2
    print(f"Number: {num}, Square: {square}")
